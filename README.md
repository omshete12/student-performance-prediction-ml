# Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning 📊

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting students’ final performance scores using
machine learning regression techniques. The objective is to analyze academic
data, visualize key patterns, and compare different regression models to
determine their effectiveness in predicting student outcomes.

## Problem Statement
To build and evaluate machine learning models that can predict a student’s
final score based on available academic-related features.

## Dataset
The dataset contains student-related attributes that are used as input features
for predicting final performance scores. The data is analyzed and visualized
to better understand trends and distributions.

> Note: The dataset is used for academic and learning purposes.

## Machine Learning Models Used
The following regression models were implemented and evaluated:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor

## Data Visualization
Basic data visualizations were created using Matplotlib to better understand
the dataset and support model analysis.

## Evaluation Metrics
Model performance was evaluated using standard regression metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

## Project Workflow
1. Load and inspect the dataset
2. Perform exploratory data analysis and visualization
3. Separate features and target variable
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Train multiple regression models
6. Evaluate and compare model performance

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure the dataset file is in the project directory
3. Open `projectfinal.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
4. Run all cells sequentially

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding of regression-based machine learning problems
- Hands-on experience with data visualization using Matplotlib
- Practical knowledge of model evaluation metrics
- Experience comparing multiple machine learning models
